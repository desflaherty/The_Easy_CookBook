In this project, youâ€™ll be building a data-driven web application using the technologies that you have learned throughout Data Centric Development. You can either choose to to follow the example brief below, or you can use your own idea for the website.

# Project Name: The Easy CookBook:

I decided to use the sample brief given to students for the project to create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes.
I used Mongodb as the backend database as the previous course tutorial using pymongo used this NoSql database engine and my project builds upon the course
tutorial adding extra functionality.

The project developed should allow users to 

* Search and display recipes by different criteria
* Add, edit update and delete a recipe on the site , preforming CRUD operations.
* Display a single detailed recipe page
* Optional register and login functionality to allow a user to track their own recipes.
* Design a backend database to group recipes by attributes such as Cuisine, Country, Ingredients

## UX

*Strategy:*
The intention for this project would be to create a recipe cookbook that is responsive and visually appealing and uses the frameworks and technologies covered thus
far in the course.

*User Stories:*
As a user of the recipe cookbook I should be able to:
* Browse a listing of all recipes and click into a detailed view of each recipe
* Filter the recipes by searching using different criteria such as Cuisine, Course, Occasion, Special Diet 
* Filter the recipes by searching using a keyword value that would find an ingredient or food type
* Be able to register and login to the site using a username and password that I have supplied
* On login be able to add recipes to the site and view all the recipes I have created
* Be able to preform CRUD operations while I am logged in such as Adding, Editing, Updating and Deleting my recipe.
* Be able to view a detailed page of the recipe to include cooking time, ingredients and instrucitons with an optional image displayed

A mockups for the proposed cookbook can be viewed on githib
